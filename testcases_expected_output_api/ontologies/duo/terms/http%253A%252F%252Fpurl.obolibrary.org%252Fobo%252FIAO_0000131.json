    "A serial number is an information content entity which is a unique sequence of characters borne by part of manufactured product or its packaging that is assigned to each individual in some class of products, and so can serve as a way to identify an individual product within the class. Serial numbers can be encoded in a variety of other information objects, such as bar codes, numerals, or patterns of dots."
