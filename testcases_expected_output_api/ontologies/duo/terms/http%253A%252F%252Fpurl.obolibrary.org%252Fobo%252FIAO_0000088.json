    "A document assembled by an author for the purpose of providing information for the audience. A report is the output of a documenting process and has the objective to be consumed by a specific audience. Topic of the report is on something that has completed. A report is not a single figure. Examples of reports are journal article, patent application, grant progress report, case report (not patient record)."

      "2009-03-16: comment from Darren Natale: I am slightly uneasy with the sentence \"Topic of the report is on \nsomething that has completed.\"  Should it be restricted to those things \nthat are completed?  For example, a progress report is (usually) about \nsomething that definitely has *not* been completed, or may include \n(only) projections.  I think the definition would not suffer if the \nwhole sentence is deleted.",
      "2009-03-16: this was report of results with definition: A report is a narrative object that is a formal statement of the results of an investigation, or of any matter on which definite information is required, made by some person or body instructed or required to do so.",
      "2009-03-16: work has been done on this term during during the OBI workshop winter 2009 and the current definition was considered acceptable for use in OBI. If there is a need to modify this definition please notify OBI.",
      "2009-08-10 Alan Ruttenberg: Larry Hunter suggests that this be obsoleted and replaced by 'document'. Alan restored as there are OBI dependencies and this merits further discussion",
      "disagreement about where reports go. alan: only some gene lists are reports. Is a report all the content of some document? The example of usage suggests that a report may be part of  some article. Term needs clarification"
