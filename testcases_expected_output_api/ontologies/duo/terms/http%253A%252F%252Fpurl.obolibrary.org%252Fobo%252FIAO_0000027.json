      "2/2/2009 Alan and Bjoern discussing FACS run output data. This is a data item because it is about the cell population. Each element records an event and is typically further composed a set of measurment data items that record the fluorescent intensity stimulated by one of the lasers.",
      "2009-03-16: data item deliberatly ambiguous: we merged data set and datum to be one entity, not knowing how to define singular versus plural. So data item is more general than datum.",
      "2009-03-16: removed datum as alternative term as datum specifically refers to singular form, and is thus not an exact synonym.",
      "JAR: datum     -- well, this will be very tricky to define, but maybe some \ninformation-like stuff that might be put into a computer and that is \nmeant, by someone, to denote and/or to be interpreted by some \nprocess... I would include lists, tables, sentences... I think I might \ndefer to Barry, or to Brian Cantwell Smith\n\nJAR: A data item is an approximately justified approximately true approximate belief"
