      "2009-03-16: original definition when imported from OBI read: \"objective is an non realizable information entity which can serve as that  proper part of a plan towards which the realization of the plan is directed.\"",
      "2014-03-31: In the example of usage (\"In the protocol of a ChIP assay the objective specification says to identify protein and DNA interaction\") there is a protocol which is the ChIP assay protocol. In addition to being concretized on paper, the protocol can be concretized as a realizable entity, such as a plan that inheres in a person. The objective specification is the part that says that some protein and DNA interactions are identified. This is a specification of a process endpoint: the boundary in the process before which they are not identified and after which they are. During the realization of the plan, the goal is to get to the point of having the interactions, and participants in the realization of the plan try to do that.",
