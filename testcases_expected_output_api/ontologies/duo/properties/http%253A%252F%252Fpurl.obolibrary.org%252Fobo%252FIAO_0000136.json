Weaken the is_about relationship to be primitive. \n\nWe will try to build it back up by elaborating the various subproperties that are more precisely defined.\n\nSome currently missing phenomena that should be considered \"about\" are predications - \"The only person who knows the answer is sitting beside me\" , Allegory, Satire, and other literary forms that can be topical without explicitly mentioning the topic."
