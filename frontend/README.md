## Development: Running OLS4 frontend locally

This will require NPM.
Inside the frontend directory, you can run:


    npm install

This downloads dependencies defined in the project and generates a `node_modules` folder with the installed dependencies.


    npm start

This runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) to view it in the browser.
The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.


    npm run build

This builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
